1) The most obvious analysis that the closer the city is to the equator, the higher the temperature. This statement is supported by the scatter plot, and the r-values for both northern and southern hemisphere.


Further, the higher the temperature, the greater percent of humidity. Again, this was an expected conclusion since humidity is measured by the amount of water in the air, and water gets trapped in the air at higher temperatures. This statement is also supported by a scatter plot, and the r-values for both northern and southern hemispheres. 

2) There is no evidence that cloudiness is effected by latitude. The scatter plot shows cloudiness levels are evenly distributed across all latitudes.

3) Wind speed does not seem to be effected by latitude either. However there are few data points for wind speeds over 25mph. It's fair to conclude that fewer cities are located in zones with high wind speeds as high winds are less habitable by humans.
